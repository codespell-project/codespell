# Python3 program to print DFS traversal
# from a given graph
from collections import defaultdict


# This class represents a directed graph using
# adjacency list representation
class Graph:

	# Constructor
	def __init__(self):

		# Default dictionary to store graph
		self.graph = defaultdict(list)

	
	# Function to add an edge to graph
	def addEdge(self, u, v):
		self.graph[u].append(v)

	
	# A function used by DFS
	def DFSUtil(self, v, visited):

		# Mark the current node as visited
		# and print it
		visited.add(v)
		print(v, end=' ')

		# Recur for all the vertices
		# adjacent to this vertex
		for neighbour in self.graph[v]:
			if neighbour not in visited:
				self.DFSUtil(neighbour, visited)

	
	# The function to do DFS traversal. It uses
	# recursive DFSUtil()
	def DFS(self, v):

		# Create a set to store visited vertices
		visited = set()

		# Call the recursive helper function
		# to print DFS traversal
		self.DFSUtil(v, visited)
